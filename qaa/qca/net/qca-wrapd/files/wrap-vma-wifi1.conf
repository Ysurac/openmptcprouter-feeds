# This is a sample file shows how to use user pre-allocated collision-
# free MAC addresses for Q-WRAP. MAC addresses listed below will be
# used first when creating ProxySTA VAP's. After the listed MAC
# addresses are exhausted, the auto configuration daemon will start
# to use the MAC addresses with the LA (locally administered) bit set
# to the original client's MAC address to create ProxySTA VAP's.
